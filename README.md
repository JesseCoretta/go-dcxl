Package `dcxl` implements **draft-coretta-x660-ldap**, an Internet Draft (ID) of which I am the author.

NOTE: The ID is not yet approved and is currently expired, pending review. It should be considered EXPERIMENTAL and is absolutely not yet intended for production use.

## Package Status

This package is under heavy, active development. Volatility should be expected for the interim.

## Other Repositories

* [`draft-coretta-x660-ldap`](https://github.com/JesseCoretta/draft-coretta-x660-ldap) - the official repository for the draft-coretta-x660-ldap ID effort. Contains usable LDAP schemata and some example LDIF content.
